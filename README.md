# 1. Business Understanding

  Churn represents the number of customers who end their relationship with a company within a specific period (Danao & Watts, 2024). This occurs when customers or subscribers stop engaging with your business. 
  As a key business metric, the churn rate is crucial for understanding customer behavior and loyalty, especially in a competitive market. Gaining this insight is vital for sustaining growth. Knowing your churn rate is essential for making decisions that enhance customer retention and loyalty. It allows you to assess your marketing strategy, the products you're offering, and, ultimately, predict your business's financial health. With this information, companies can adjust their strategies and refocus efforts to reduce churn.
  A higher churn rate signals that customers are leaving your business, resulting in lost clients. The “revenue churn rate” further highlights the percentage of revenue lost due to customer attrition, and both metrics are expressed as percentages.
  The importance of customer retention goes beyond loyalty; it's also cost-effective. Acquiring a new customer is five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one (Gallo, 2014). Furthermore, Reichheld of Bain & Company (2021) found that increasing customer retention by just 5% can boost profits by 25% to 95%.
  Danao and Watts (2024) suggest that for mature and established companies, the ideal annual churn rate is between 5% and 7%, with a monthly churn rate of less than 1%. Nonetheless, the churn depend on the field of company. A 1% churn rate can represent millions of dollars in loss, hence it is necessary to understand the impact of churn on the business you are involved with (Truta, 2018).
  By actively monitoring churn rates, businesses can identify trends and areas for improvement, enabling them to implement targeted strategies to reduce customer loss and drive long-term success.
  The purpose of Part 1 of the project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a public bank dataset, providing insights to identify customers with a higher likelihood of churning.
